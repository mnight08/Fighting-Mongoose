A pidget(problem widget) is a webwork problem component.  It consist of 
certain variables in a homework problem.  A pidget may be 
made up of other pidgets.  


Some pidgets will have answer checkers and fields to evaluate answers. 


The editor and its graphical tools are based on this view of problems.  
The graphical tool should allow us to drag and drop pidgets into a problem. The editor should also parse any given webwork problem into a collection of pidgets that represent that problem.
